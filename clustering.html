<h2>About</h2>
<p>Categorising software systems according to their functionality yields many benefits to both users and developers. Therefore, in order to uncover the latent clustering of mobile apps in app stores, we proposed a novel technique that measures app similarity based on claimed behaviour. This is done by extracting features using information retrieval augmented with ontological analysis and used as attributes to characterise apps. These attributes are then used to cluster the apps using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We empirically evaluated our approach on 17,877 apps mined from the BlackBerry and Google app stores in 2014. The results show that our approach dramatically improved the existing categorisation quality for both Blackberry (from 0.02 to 0.41 on average) and Google (from 0.03 to 0.21 on average) stores. We also found a strong Spearman rank correlation (ρ= 0.96 for Google and ρ= 0.99 for BlackBerry) between the number of apps and the ideal granularity within each category, indicating that ideal granularity increases with category size, as expected. </p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>This dataset has been collected in August 2014 from both BlackBerry App World and Google Play Apps stores. It contains the metadata of each app (not the app’s executables) including raw description and category. The total number of apps is 14,258 belonging to 16 different categories in Blackberry App World and 3,619 apps from 23 high-level categories in the Google Play App store.</p>
